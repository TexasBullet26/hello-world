# hello-world

This is my first repository.

My name is Trey, I am 27, and I am a student at freecodecamp.com. 
I've learned quite a bit of HTML and CSS so far..
I'm now learning the basics of JavaScript.
Before freecodecamp.com, I learned HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript using web resourses such as SoloLearn and CodeCademy.
This is something that I enjoy doing and hope I build a career with.
I can use any help or pointers from absolutely anyone to help me grow in this field..One day I hope to be able to help.
You can contact me with e-mail at lanzertrey@gmail.com

Thank You!!
