# Hello World!!

#### This was my first repository.

My name is Trey, I'm 28 years old and I am a student at The University of North Texas as well as [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) 

Thus far I've learned mostly front-end such as:
  - **HTML**
  - **CSS**
  - **Bootstrap**
  - **JavaScript**

I've also learned a bit of back-end and dev-ops such as:
  - **Node.js**
  - **Python**
  - **Git**
  - **Jekyll**

As of now I'm trying to focus on mastering JavaScript.
Before freecodecamp.com, I learned HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript using web resourses such as SoloLearn and CodeCademy.

This is something that I enjoy doing and hope I build a career with.
I can use any help or pointers from absolutely anyone to help me grow in this field. I'm getting used to the Git command line and GitHub and I've started to contribute to open-source and always will.

You can contact me with e-mail at lanzertrey@gmail.com

Thank You!!
